# Eager No UI Example App

This is an example app for [Eager](https://eager.io).

The app adds a fake page view counter to the page, at a location chosen by
the installer.  To try it out download this project to your computer, and open the folder
in the [App Tester](https://eager.io/developer/app-tester).

It is an example of an app which adds an element to the page at a user-selected location.
